##### I am a fresh graduate in Software Engineering from Institut Teknologi Garut. I have a strong interest in software development, particularly in web-based applications. I am accustomed to working in teams, possess solid system analysis skills, and am open to new technologies and continuous learning.During my studies, I actively developed several web and Android-based projects using technologies such as Java, JavaScript, PHP, Laravel, MySQL, and other modern frameworks. I also have a good understanding of information system analysis and design, and I am familiar with using Git and GitHub for version control and project management.
